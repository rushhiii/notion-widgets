Your widgets will be live at `https://YOUR_VERCEL_APP.vercel.app/clock`, `/timer`, etc.

## Widget Routes

- `/clock`
- `/timer`
- `/stopwatch`
- `/dday`
- `/quotes`
- `/weather`
- `/progress`
- `/music-player`
- `/audio-player`

## Instance IDs

Use `instance` to isolate settings or saved state across multiple embeds of the same widget. Only `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, and `-` are kept.

Supported for stateful widgets (clock, progress, music player). Safe to include on quotes and D-Day for consistent link naming.

Example:

- `/progress?instance=work&embed=1`

## Common Query Params

- Clock: `tz`, `format`, `seconds`, `theme`, `controls`, `size`, `bg`, `text`, `instance`
- Timer: `t`, `start`, `theme`, `controls`, `size`
- Stopwatch: `t`, `start`, `theme`, `controls`, `size`
- Quotes: `category`, `source`, `mode`, `rotate`, `interval`, `bg`, `border`, `text`, `accent`, `instance`
- D-Day: `date`, `mode`, `align`, `showdate`, `bg`, `color`, `titleColor`, `dayColor`, `timeColor`, `instance`
- Weather: `location`, `lat`, `lon`, `units`, `mode`, `details`, `theme`, `bg`, `text`, `accent`
- Progress: `title`, `label`, `goal`, `progress`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `accent`, `track`, `text`, `bg`, `embed`, `instance`
- Music Player: `server`, `type`, `id`, `colorscheme`, `theme`, `loop`, `order`, `preload`, `volume`, `list-folded`, `list-max-height`, `storage-name`, `instance`
- Audio Player: `layout`, `src`, `title`, `artist`, `cover`, `data`, `accent`, `bg`, `text`, `volume`, `start`, `loop`, `queue`, `autoplay`, `instance`

## Audio Player (Custom MP3)

Native HTML audio widget for custom MP3 files and JSON playlists hosted in your repo/CDN/object storage.

Examples:

- Small single-track:
   `https://notion.busiyi.world/audio-player/?layout=small&src=/audio/instrumental.mp3&title=my%20magic%20shop&artist=instrumental&embed=1`
- Medium card:
   `https://notion.busiyi.world/audio-player/?layout=medium&src=/audio/satisfaction.mp3&title=Satisfaction&artist=The%20Rolling%20Stones&embed=1`
- Large playlist from JSON:
   `https://notion.busiyi.world/audio-player/?layout=large&data=/audio/playlist.json&queue=1&loop=playlist&embed=1`

Playlist JSON shape:

```json
[
  {
    "src": "/audio/track-1.mp3",
    "title": "Satellite",
    "artist": "Harry Styles",
    "cover": "/audio/covers/satellite.jpg"
  }
]
```

Options:

| option | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| layout | `small` | `small`, `medium`, or `large` |
| src | optional | Single track mp3 URL (relative or absolute) |
| title | `Instrumental Track` | Display title for single track |
| artist | `Custom Source` | Display artist for single track |
| cover | optional | Cover image URL |
| data | optional | Playlist JSON URL (array or `{ "tracks": [] }`) |
| accent | by layout | Accent color |
| bg | by layout | Background color |
| text | by layout | Text color |
| volume | `0.8` | Initial volume (0..1) |
| start | `0` | Initial track index for playlist mode |
| loop | `none` | `none`, `track`, `playlist` |
| queue | `1` | Show queue list in large mode |
| autoplay | `0` | Autoplay on load |
| instance | optional | Isolates data variations and link naming |

### Using A Friend's Repo As Datasource

Yes, this works. Keep the widget code in this repo and host audio files + playlist JSON in another public repo.

Recommended hosting URL format (better than raw.githubusercontent):

- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<owner>/<repo>@<branch>/<path-to-file>`

Example friend repo layout:

```txt
audio-assets/
   playlist.json
   tracks/
      intro.mp3
      ambient-loop.mp3
   covers/
      intro.jpg
      ambient-loop.jpg
```

Example `playlist.json` in your friend's repo:

```json
[
   {
      "src": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/friendname/audio-assets@main/tracks/intro.mp3",
      "title": "Intro",
      "artist": "Instrumental",
      "cover": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/friendname/audio-assets@main/covers/intro.jpg"
   }
]
```

Then use this in your widget URL:

- `/audio-player?layout=large&data=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/friendname/audio-assets@main/playlist.json&embed=1`

Notes:

- Repo/files must be public, or the browser cannot fetch them.
- Keep file names stable and URL-safe.
- Very large files are better on object storage/CDN (R2/S3) if you scale up.

### Using Cloudflare R2

Cloudflare R2 is the best fit if you want to host a few GB of MP3s with direct public URLs.

1. Create an R2 bucket in Cloudflare.
2. Upload your `tracks/` and `covers/` files.
3. Make the bucket public, or expose it through a public custom domain.
4. Build `playlist.json` so every `src` and `cover` points to the public R2 URL for that object.
5. Point the audio player `data` parameter at the public `playlist.json` URL.

Example playlist entry using a public R2 domain:

```json
[
   {
      "src": "https://media.example.com/tracks/ENG/21%20Savage%20-%20Rockstar.mp3",
      "title": "Rockstar",
      "artist": "21 Savage",
      "cover": "https://media.example.com/covers/21-savage-rockstar.jpg",
      "category": "eng",
      "type": "speed up"
   }
]
```

If you keep the bucket private, the widget needs a small signing proxy so it can request short-lived URLs from your app before playback.

If you do not want to add billing details, do not use R2. Cloudflare may still require a payment method to enable the subscription, even if you stay within the free monthly limits.

### No-Card Alternative

If you want public audio hosting without adding a card, use a host that supports public direct links with no payment setup. Internet Archive is the most practical fallback for a multi-GB audio library.

Basic flow:

1. Upload the MP3s to a public Internet Archive item.
2. Copy the direct file URLs for each track.
3. Generate `playlist.json` with those URLs.
4. Point the audio-player `data` param at the JSON file.

This avoids billing setup and still works with the widget's existing playlist loader.

## Private Music Collection Setup

If you are managing a private music collection repo (for example, [MyMusicCollection](https://github.com/V0idVanguard/MyMusicCollection)), you can use it as a datasource for the audio player while keeping files restricted.

### Option A: Public Repo with Restrictive License (Simple)

1. Host audio in a public repo with a restrictive "Personal Use" license.
2. Use jsDelivr CDN links to the repo files (as shown in the friend repo section above).
3. License restricts usage legally (not technically), but files are publicly accessible.
4. Best for: small/medium collections, when you trust the license to deter misuse.

Example:
- Repository: `https://github.com/V0idVanguard/MyMusicCollection`
- Playlist JSON: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/V0idVanguard/MyMusicCollection@main/playlist.json`
- Widget URL: `/audio-player?layout=large&data=<above-json-url>&embed=1`

### Option B: Private Bucket with Signed URLs (Secure)

1. Store audio in a private Cloudflare R2 bucket (free-tier friendly for ~3GB).
2. Create an API endpoint in your widget app that generates short-lived signed URLs.
3. Widget first fetches playlist metadata, then requests signed URLs from your API.
4. Signed URLs expire quickly (2–10 minutes), so files stay private.
5. Best for: full privacy, no direct public file access.

Implementation coming soon. For a public bucket, use the R2 section above and skip signing.

## License for Music Assets

See `MUSIC_COLLECTION_LICENSE.txt` for the template license you can use in your private music collection repos.

Powered by APlayer + MetingJS, supports both Netease and Tencent playlists/songs/albums/artists/search.

Examples:

   `https://notion.busiyi.world/music-player/?server=tencent&type=playlist&id=7888484143`
- Netease playlist with list height:
   `https://notion.busiyi.world/music-player/?server=netease&type=playlist&id=12528089157&list-max-height=96`
- Netease song with forced dark mode:
   `https://notion.busiyi.world/music-player/?server=netease&type=song&id=28285910&colorscheme=dark`

## Recent Updates

- Instance IDs added to progress, quotes, D-Day, and music player builders; stateful widgets now scope storage by instance.
- D-Day builder now supports compact mode, default/dark/light theme handling, centered compact tiles, and separate title/text color controls.
- Progress widget now persists +/- edits in embedded mode across refreshes.
- Landing page typography and hero styling were updated to use Libre Baskerville for headings.
- CSS import typing issue in `app/layout.tsx` was fixed with a global declaration file.

## Notion Quotes Sync

1. Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Set `NOTION_TOKEN` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`.
3. Share your Notion database with the integration.
4. Run `npm run sync:quotes`.

## Vercel Quote Sync (Free Plan)

This repo is configured so production deploys always sync Notion quotes before building:

- `vercel.json` uses `buildCommand: npm run sync:quotes && next build`
- A daily cron is configured at `/api/cron/sync-quotes`

Important for Vercel Hobby (free) plan:

- Cron frequency is limited to once per day.
- Invocation can happen any minute within the configured hour (UTC).

Required Vercel environment variables:

- `NOTION_TOKEN`
- `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`
- `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`
- `CRON_SECRET` (recommended, must be random and long)

Set up steps:

1. In Vercel, create a Deploy Hook for your production branch.
2. Add `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` from that hook.
3. Add a random `CRON_SECRET`.
4. Redeploy once so cron + env changes are active.

## How to Confirm Cron Is Running

Use this quick checklist in Vercel:

1. Open project Settings -> Cron Jobs.
2. Confirm `/api/cron/sync-quotes` is listed and enabled.
3. Click View Logs on that cron entry.
4. Look for logs from `app/api/cron/sync-quotes` like:
   - `[cron/sync-quotes] Trigger accepted`
   - `[cron/sync-quotes] Deploy hook queued successfully`
5. Open Deployments and confirm a new production deployment was created near that timestamp.

Manual health test (recommended):

- Send `POST https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/cron/sync-quotes` with header `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`
- Expected response: JSON with `ok: true`
- Then verify a new deployment starts in Vercel.

Notes for Hobby plan:

- Cron can run any minute within the configured hour (UTC), not always exact minute.
- Cron failures are not retried automatically, so check logs when a run is missed.

## Trigger Sync On Notion Changes

Because Hobby cron only runs daily, you can trigger an early sync whenever new quotes are added.

Use this endpoint:

- `POST /api/cron/sync-quotes`

Authorize with either:

- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`
- Or query param: `?secret=<CRON_SECRET>`

What happens next:

1. Endpoint verifies secret.
2. Endpoint calls your Vercel deploy hook.
3. New production build runs `npm run sync:quotes`.
4. Updated quotes are included in your live site.

You can connect this endpoint to any automation tool (for example Make/Zapier/n8n) that fires on Notion database changes.

## SEO and Indexing

SEO baseline added in this repo:

- Rich global metadata in `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/sitemap.ts` for all public widget routes
- `app/robots.ts` with sitemap reference and crawl rules
- Private routes under `app/prvt/` are marked `noindex`

To use your real domain in canonical metadata and sitemap, set:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com`
